I'm super excited to share my recent hands-on project — an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks mobile sales across India 🇮🇳📱

After diving deep into data analytics over the past year, I took it a step further by learning how to create dynamic, 
visually rich dashboards that help turn raw data into meaningful insights.

🚀 What I learned:
 ✅ Building slicers and filters for drill-downs
 ✅ Creating custom visuals (map, KPIs, line/bar/pie charts)
 ✅ Using DAX for powerful calculated metrics
 ✅ Enhancing storytelling with bookmarks and clean UI design

💼 This dashboard shows:

1. Total sales & quantity
2. City-wise & month-wise trends
3. Payment method insights
4. Ratings & top-performing models
🧠 Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modelling
📍 Project Goal: Turn mobile sales data into actionable insights for business teams
